What's that?

Simple game written in WPF. (yeah, I know WPF is not well suited for games) It's far from being amazing, but it's here so, as The Beatles once told me, just let it be.

Why?

To pass one of university classes.

Why is it here?

There was a possibility to just give a github link to person grading project. So it ended up being here. Also, now I have something in C#.

How to run it?

Don't remember. If you have Visual Studio it should guide you. If you don't, well, install Visual Studio.
